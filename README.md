Switch-SDFiles-Autobuilder
==========================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Brawl345/Switch-SDFiles-Autobuilder.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Brawl345/Switch-SDFiles-Autobuilder)

Test repository for the Nintendo Switch Autobuilder for the sdfiles.zip (hekate). Use at your own risk!

I don't know why GitHub Releases sorting is messed up - always grab the [latest version](https://github.com/Brawl345/Switch-SDFiles-Autobuilder/releases/latest).

## TODO
- [ ] Add AppstoreNX (can't compile without SDL, maybe wget?)
- [ ] Only deploy for changes
- [ ] Deal with GitHub Releases sorting (why is it messed up!?)
- [X] Replace version in hekate_ipl.ini with date
- [ ] Cache Git repos (maybe needs make clean)
- [ ] Build nightlies
